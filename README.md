# SOFTENG 350 Assignment
The aim of this assignment was to develop a hi-fi prototype as a mock-up Web interface. I was tasked with the design a website for a business called “Carbon Tiptoe! (CT)” including its registration form. CT intends to use this website in order to enable users to calculate and compare their carbon footprints. I was tasked with developing their website. It includes a registration form which will allow new members to fill up their details and submit the form. The business will then handle future carbon footprint initiatives and other member benefits.
